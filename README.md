# Data_API

This is the public API to access the data stored in the OpenAg Foundations back end.

This 4.0.1 version only supports our User Interfaces and PFCS.

The next version may support the community built MVP and other devices.

You will have to create a user account to access this API, do using our [education UI](https://openag-v1.appspot.com/).
